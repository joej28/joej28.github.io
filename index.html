  <h3> Chiropractor </h3>
  
  <h3> Summary </h3>
  <p> I have always been one to push myself to try new experiences.  throughout my academci career I was also head captain and coach of my collegiate rugby team, eared a 2nd degree black belt in Tae Kwon Do, 1st degree black belt in Hopkido and have even taken up a new hobby of obstacle course racing which has continued to be a hobby into my professional career.
    All of these experiences have not only taught me the value of teamwork, but also time management, leadership and how to be adaptable to any situation.  This has helped mold me into an individual who not only has achieved a consdierable amount, but also prepared me for the task of providing great care to my patients. </p>
